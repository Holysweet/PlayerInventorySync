# PlayerInventorySync ðŸ”„

You know that moment where you place a block, it vanishes,  
and you have to walk over to a chest to *find where it went*? ðŸ˜¤  
Or when you scoop a bucket of lava and suddenlyâ€¦ nope, bucketâ€™s empty?  

**PlayerInventorySync** fixes those annoying inventory desyncs by instantly snapping your inventory back in sync when Minecraft gets confused.
