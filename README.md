# Player Inventory Sync

*You know that moment when you place a block, it vanishes, and you have to open a chest just to get it back? This mod makes that a thing of the past.*

## What This Mod Does
Player Inventory Sync fixes common client/server inventory desync issues by automatically resyncing your inventory only when necessary.  
No extra features, no nonsense — just a clean, surgical fix.

### Prevents:
- Blocks disappearing after placement in protected or cancelled areas.
- Items not returning to inventory when use is denied.
- Buckets pulling from the wrong source (e.g., from a tank instead of the intended fluid block).
- Needing to open a container to force inventory updates.

## Compatibility
- Works in singleplayer and multiplayer.
- Designed to be lightweight and conflict-free.
- No gameplay changes — purely a desync prevention fix.
